## 1 Can I use matching double quotes for string literals instead of single quotes? 
		YES

## 2 Can I compare strings using comparison operators such as == and < or built-in functions such as max() and min()? 
		YES

## 3 What does the expression 1/0 evaluate to in Python?
	       (C) ERROR

## 4 Is there a difference between = and == ?
		YES. ( = for assigning variables, while == used as a comparison operator (i.e Boolean)

## 5 Will a = b = c = 17 set the three variables to 17?
		YES

## 6 Give the value of a after the execution of each of the following sequences:

		Equation / function		value of a after execution
		a = 1 					= 1                              
		a = a + a    			        = 2         
		a = a + a 				= 4                         
		a = a + a  			        = 8          
		a = True				= True
		a = not a  				= False
		a = not a   			        = True
		a = not a 				= False     
		a = 2 					= 2
		a = a * a				= 4
		a = a * a				= 16
		a = a * a         		        = 256 

		The value of a is 256
